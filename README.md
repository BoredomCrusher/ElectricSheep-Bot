# ElectricSheep Bot

A Python-based Discord bot for my writing group, with the following planned functions:

1.) Scrapes [the submission grinder](https://thegrinder.diabolicalplots.com/) once a day for current creative writing submission call markets, posting it to the discord once per day.


2.) Posts and updates a daily tracker for reading and writing every day.

3.) Helps manage and keeps track of a collaberative "Exquisite Corpse" project, where writers take turns adding prose to the same story.

4.) Comments "¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯" if "/shrug" is typed anywhere in a comment. 

Possible additions:

1.) If I wake up and decide I hate my GPU:

  • Use bot to mine Bitcoin until my computer is set on fire.
